# vendor

To enable builds on systems that don't have the Rockchip MPP library installed, the required headers are vendored here.

The current headers are copied from the latest `librockchip-mpp-dev` release available on Ubuntu at the time of writing: [1.5.0-1+git20240213.c5b070ec](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/mpp/tree/c5b070ec28adcdd3f8ca1cb6b56202d5781eb6ce).
