# ffmpeg

This crate contains lowish level facilities for working with FFmpeg bindings, intended for use with [https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg-sys](github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg-sys).

It's not intended to be an all-encompassing abstraction as much of our work is too specialized for high level FFmpeg abstractions, and we generally gravitate away from FFmpeg dependencies when feasible.
